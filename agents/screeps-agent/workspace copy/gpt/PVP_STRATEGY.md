# GPT PvP Strategy Guide - Screeps Arena

## Current Situation Analysis
- **Game Time**: 5153 (mid-game)
- **Room**: W5N5 (controlled)
- **Status**: Normal (spawn intact)
- **Threat Level**: LOW (no enemies detected)
- **Critical Vulnerability**: 0 creeps (completely defenseless)

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Next 10-20 ticks)

### 1. EMERGENCY DEFENSE (Critical - Do First)
**Objective**: Get at least 2 creeps spawned immediately
- Spawn 1 harvester: [WORK, CARRY, MOVE] (200 energy)
- Spawn 1 defender: [TOUGH, ATTACK, MOVE, MOVE] (190 energy)
- These provide basic resource gathering and immediate defense

### 2. RAPID ECONOMIC EXPANSION (High Priority)
**Objective**: Build economy to support military production
- Build extensions around spawn (increase energy capacity)
- Target: 5 harvesters, 3 upgraders, 2 builders by tick 5200
- Build containers at energy sources for efficiency

### 3. DEFENSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE (Medium Priority)
**Objective**: Create automated defense systems
- Build towers (1-2 initially) for automated defense
- Build ramparts around critical structures
- Target completion by controller level 3

## PHASE-BASED STRATEGY

### EARLY GAME (Controller Level 1-2)
**Focus**: Survival + Economic Foundation
- Creep ratio: 60% economy, 30% defense, 10% scouting
- Build order: Extensions → Containers → Basic walls
- Military: 1-2 defenders, 1 scout for intelligence

### MID GAME (Controller Level 3-5)
**Focus**: Military Expansion + Territory Control
- Creep ratio: 40% economy, 40% military, 20% support
- Build order: Towers → Ramparts → Advanced military units
- Military: Mixed forces (attackers, rangers, healers)

### LATE GAME (Controller Level 6+)
**Focus**: Domination + Enemy Elimination
- Creep ratio: 30% economy, 60% military, 10% special ops
- Build order: Advanced defenses → Remote bases
- Military: Coordinated attacks on enemy spawns

## MILITARY UNIT COMPOSITION

### Defensive Units
- **Defender**: [TOUGH, ATTACK, MOVE] - Melee defense
- **Guard**: [TOUGH, RANGED_ATTACK, MOVE] - Ranged defense
- **Tower Support**: Automated damage dealing

### Offensive Units
- **Attacker**: [ATTACK, MOVE] - Spawn/siege destruction
- **Ranger**: [RANGED_ATTACK, MOVE] - Harassment/damage
- **Healer**: [HEAL, MOVE] - Support units
- **Scout**: [MOVE] - Intelligence gathering

### Unit Roles
- **Scouts**: Map enemy positions, identify weak targets
- **Harassers**: Hit enemy economy, force defensive positioning
- **Siege Units**: Destroy enemy spawns and critical structures
- **Defense Force**: Protect own base and economic units

## TACTICAL APPROACHES

### Aggressive Expansion
1. Scout adjacent rooms for weak enemies
2. Build military force while maintaining economy
3. Attack when military advantage >2:1
4. Target enemy spawns first, then economy

### Defensive Counter-Attack
1. Build strong tower defense
2. Lure enemies into tower range
3. Counter-attack with fresh military units
4. Exploit enemy losses to expand

### Economic Warfare
1. Target enemy harvesters and sources
2. Deny enemy energy collection
3. Force enemy to spend resources on defense
4. Expand while enemy is weakened

## KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

### Economic Metrics
- Energy collection rate per tick
- Controller upgrade progress
- Extension count and energy capacity
- Construction site completion rate

### Military Metrics
- Military creep count vs enemies
- Enemy structure damage dealt
- Own structure damage taken
- Room control expansion rate

### Intelligence Metrics
- Enemy room scanning frequency
- Enemy military composition knowledge
- Threat level assessment accuracy
- Attack timing effectiveness

## EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### Under Attack
1. Immediately spawn defenders
2. Pull harvesters to safety
3. Focus tower fire on healers first
4. Counter-attack when defense stabilizes

### Spawn Destroyed
1. Respawn immediately if possible
2. Focus on rebuilding economy first
3. Build hidden extensions for energy
4. Rebuild military for revenge attacks

### Economic Collapse
1. Prioritize harvester spawning
2. Build containers at sources
3. Focus on single-source efficiency
4. Scout for expansion opportunities

## ADVANCED TACTICS

### Multi-Room Operations
- Coordinate attacks from multiple directions
- Use scouts to find enemy weak points
- Time attacks with economic disruptions
- Maintain supply lines for extended campaigns

### Psychological Warfare
- Fake attacks to force defensive builds
- Hit-and-run tactics to frustrate enemies
- Target high-value structures for morale impact
- Use scouts to create uncertainty

### Resource Denial
- Occupy enemy energy sources
- Destroy enemy containers and extensions
- Block enemy expansion with military presence
- Force enemies to over-extend their defenses

## VICTORY CONDITIONS

### Primary Objective
**Destroy all enemy spawns** while maintaining at least one of your own.

### Secondary Objectives
1. Control maximum number of rooms
2. Maintain highest GCL (Global Control Level)
3. Inflict maximum enemy casualties
4. Minimize own economic losses

## CURRENT ACTION PLAN

### Immediate Actions (Next 5 minutes)
1. Spawn emergency harvester and defender
2. Build 2 extensions near spawn
3. Scout adjacent rooms for threats
4. Begin controller upgrade focus

### Short-term Goals (Next 30 minutes)
1. Reach 5 harvesters, 3 upgraders
